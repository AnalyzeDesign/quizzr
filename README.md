The running project can be viewed at https://rocky-shore-90283.herokuapp.com/

## Introduction
For my project, I explored creating a new project with CRUD capabilities based on the MEAN stack: MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node. Though familiar with these technologies, I had never created an application with them before.

I successfully implemented the CRUD capabilities along with a JSON Web Token saved in local storage for access control to the application. Two models of data, posts(quizzes) and users, are stored on a remote MongoDB instance.

An outside API, the New York Times Movie Review API (https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/movie-reviews-api/1/overview), was also integrated into the main dashboard to fulfill the requirements of the project. 

I have learned an immense amount during the project, and am currently working through Testing in Angular with the Karma test-runner.

## Design
This project is meant to be quiz application. The users can create, edit and share quizzes with their friends.

In its current iteration, users can register, login, create quizzes, edit quizzes, delete quizzes. Currently quizzes are shared among all registered and logged-in users.
